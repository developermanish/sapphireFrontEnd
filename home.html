                If you're visiting this page, you're likely here because you're searching for a random sentence. Sometimes a random word just isn't enough, and that is where the random sentence generator comes into play. 
                By inputting the desired number, you can make a list of as many random sentences as you want or need. Producing random sentences can be helpful in a number of different ways.
                For writers, a random sentence can help them get their creative juices flowing.The most common way to use the sentence is to begin a story. Another option is to include it somewhere in the story. A much more difficult challenge is to use it to end a story.
                In any of these cases, it forces the writer to think creatively since they have no idea what sentence will appear from the tool.

                            For writers, a random sentence can help them get their creative juices flowing. Since the topic of the sentence is completely unknown, it forces the writer to be creative when the sentence appears. There are a number of different ways a writer can use the random sentence for creativity. The most common way to use the sentence is to begin a story.

        <h2>Welcome to this codepen</h2>
        <h3>Basic Left-navigation portfolio template</h3>

        <p>This template idea is inspired from Travis Neilson's great videos (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners">his YouTube channel</a>) </p>
        <p>(note : There is a strange space at the top of the main content, don't know why. Any ideas? )
        </p>

        <h2>#2 : responsive header </h2>
        <p> The basic idea is to change the display property for the #head div (right menu) from flex to table and adjust width and height. When the screen is under 640px the main menu sticks to the top, by changing the &lt;li&gt; elements from default to inlint,
        they distribute correctly. </p>


        <pre>
        @media screen and (max-width: 640px)
        {
            #head {
            height: 125px;
            display: table;
            width: 100%;
            }
            #head ul li {
            display: inline;
            }
            #content  {
            margin-left: 0;
            margin-top: 125px;
            }
        }
        </pre>
